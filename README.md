# Hey, I'm David! ðŸ‘‹

Currently building [Mordecai](https://mordecaiapp.com). 

Mordecai is a browser-based AI programming tool, you can add live local directories to Mordecai's context through our cli tool. This lets you chat with the knowledge of your code repo/s, updating as you write to local files.

If you would like to book an onboarding call you can do so [here](https://cal.com/rossiter/15min).
